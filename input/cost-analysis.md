# Initial cost analysis

[Excerpt from pricing/rationale.md]

First, we agreed to compute the cost of the value generated in terms of standard hourly wages and time invested. For hourly rates for development contractors, on the internet, we found everything from $80/hr to > $300/hr. Using the value $125/hr, we get:

C₁ = 70 person hours × $ 125 / hour = $8750.

# Upto April 2023

The above was current as of Dec 7, 2022 (dc3ab9f).

Since then, a rough estimate of hours up to 1.1 release (Apr 25, 2023 - beaf668) is:

Approximately weekly meetings, about 2 hours each time, 3 attendees. Doing offline work between meetings in the month preceding launch, and a lot of work at launch time.

(3 people × 20 weeks × 2 hours/week) + (3 people × 4 weeks × 2 hours/week) + (3 people × 5 hours × 3 times) = 189 person hours

C₂ = 189 person hours × $ 125 / hour = $23625.

C = C₁ + C₂ = $32,375

# Upto August 2023

Rough estimate of additional hours after dc3ab9f up to d68a1be is:

Approximately weekly meetings, about 2 hours each time, 3 attendees. Some offline work between meetings.

(3 people × 12 weeks × 2 hours/week) + (3 people × 12 weeks × 0.5 hours/week) = 90 person hours

C₃ = 90 person hours × $ 125 / hour = $11250.

C = C₁ + C₂ + C₃ = $43,625
